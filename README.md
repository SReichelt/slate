# The Slate interactive theorem prover

Slate is an interactive theorem prover that is currently under development.

There are three ways of working with Slate:

## Web access

Slate can be accessed online at https://slate-prover.org/. Users can browse and edit the library graphically. Additions and changes are either submitted anonymously or as GitHub pull requests.

## VSCode extension

An [extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sreichelt.slate) integrates the entire web GUI, while also letting the user edit the source code in parallel. The extension supports most VSCode features including refactoring operations.

## Local build

The web version of Slate can also be built and executed locally. For instructions, please see [docs/dev/README.md](docs/dev/README.md).
