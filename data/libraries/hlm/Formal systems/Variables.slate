/**
 * @remarks This definition formalizes an infinite supply of variables. Each variable is identified by a natural number, but that number is not used anywhere. In fact, any infinite set would do.
 *
 *          Variables, therefore, do not carry a name. Instead, we use bound variables in HLM to model variables in the target language, and these bound variables have a name in HLM.
 *
 *          As a consequence, α-equivalent terms are never distinguishable.
