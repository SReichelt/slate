/**
 * @remarks Due to the type system of HLM, it is impossible to define the union of two arbitrary sets. Instead, both sets must be declared as subsets of a common superset _U_, although the intersection is, of course, independent of _U_. Since a suitable value for _U_ can always be inferred automatically, _U_ can be omitted from the notation.
