/**
 * @remarks There are, of course, many equivalent definitions of binary digits. The simplest definition would be a construction with two constructors. However, we also want the sets to be embedded in the natural numbers, and currently this requires everything to be mapped to a single constructor of the target set. So we simply define binary digits as a subset of the natural numbers.
