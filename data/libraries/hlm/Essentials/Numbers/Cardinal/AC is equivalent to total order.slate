/**
 * @remarks The non-circularity requirements of HLM have a subtle effect on this proposition: Even though the axiom of choice, by itself, does not exclude the set of cardinal numbers, this proposition cannot be used to conclude that the cardinal numbers have a choice function if the order on cardinal numbers is total.
