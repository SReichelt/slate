/**
 * @remarks The definition of cardinal numbers in HLM is very similar to the definition of algebraic structures such as magmas. Thus it makes sense to define a homomorphism between cardinal numbers as a function between arbitrary representatives _X_ and _Y_.
 *
 *          Although these sets are not unique, the type system prevents the ambiguities that could arise, as long as the equality definition of the structure does not define any non-isomorphic elements as equal.
