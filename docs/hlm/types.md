# The type system of the HLM logic

TBD

* Simple description how sets are interpreted as types.
  * Structural set theory.
* Similar to sets in Lean.
  * Can be regarded as a formalization of the translation from set theory to type theory that users face.
  * Experimental translation from HLM to Lean: [hlm-defs.lean](experimental/lean/hlm-defs.lean)
* Constructions (inductive data types) to build new types.
  * Equality definition.
    * Isomorphic structures are equal: [equality.md](equality.md)
  * Embeddings.
